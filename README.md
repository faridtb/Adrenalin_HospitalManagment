___
 __This program is a console project in the form of a demo, inspired by professional hospital management programs.__

___

We must first create certain users here and assign them a position. (Admin-director-doctor-staff)
 After that, we will receive a menu screen for each task.

 - __Admin screen__
As an admin, there are functions such as user, staff, doctor staff, patient, employee service, doctor service and create a new registration and edit any created object. In short, all functions become active.


- __Director screen__
Unlike the admin, there will no longer be a new user creation. All other features will be available here as well.

- __Doctor screen__
This screen has been added so that the doctor can accurately show his / her activities and easily view his / her daily reports (how many patients he / she received, at what hours, what services he / she performed) through the system.

- __Staff screen__
As the program demo is written, the category is roughly taken as an employee (it will be divided in more detail in the future - as a registrar, supplier, etc.). Only the patient can create a new object in the working system. The main functions are to open a new registration window and enter the patient (by creating a new one if there is no registered patient in the database), the doctor and the service from the database
to add to the system
